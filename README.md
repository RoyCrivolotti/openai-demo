# ChatGPT readme

Here's a sample README for the OpenAI demo using Docker:

## OpenAI Demo

This repository contains code for an OpenAI demo in Python, packaged with Docker. The demo includes examples of using
OpenAI's natural language processing models and popular scientific Python packages such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib,
and Seaborn.

### Usage

To run the demo, you need to have Docker installed on your machine. Follow the instructions on the Docker website to
download and install Docker.

Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/openai-demo.git
```

Navigate to the repository directory:

```
cd openai-demo
```

Build the Docker image:

```
docker build -t openai-demo .
```

Start the Docker container:

```
docker run -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/app openai-demo
```

This will start the JupyterLab server inside the Docker container, which you can access by navigating
to `http://localhost:8888` in your web browser.

The `-p` option maps port 8888 in the container to port 8888 on the host machine, and the `-v` option mounts the current
directory as a volume inside the container.

When you're finished, stop and remove the container:

```
docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
```

This will stop and remove all running Docker containers.

## ChatGPT instructions

Sure! Here are the files you can use:

`requirements.txt`:

```angular2html
openai
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
```

This requirements.txt file specifies the required Python packages for the OpenAI demo, including the OpenAI library and
popular scientific Python packages such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

`Dockerfile`:

```
FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 8888

CMD ["jupyter", "lab", "--ip=0.0.0.0", "--port=8888", "--no-browser", "--allow-root"]
```

This Dockerfile uses the official Python 3.9 slim-buster base image and sets the working directory to /app. It then
copies the requirements.txt file into the container and installs the required packages using pip. Finally, it copies the
contents of the current directory into the container and starts the JupyterLab server on port 8888.

`docker-compose.yml`:

```
version: '3'
services:
  openai-demo:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8888:8888"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    environment:
      - JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB=yes
```

This docker-compose.yml file defines a single service called openai-demo, which is built from the Dockerfile in the
current directory. The service maps port 8888 in the container to port 8888 on the host machine to allow access to the
JupyterLab server. It also mounts the current directory as a volume inside the container to allow changes to the code
without rebuilding the container.

Finally, it sets an environment variable `JUPYTER_ENABLE_LAB` to enable the JupyterLab interface.

To build and run the OpenAI demo container using docker-compose, navigate to the directory containing the
docker-compose.yml file and run the following command: `docker-compose up`. This will build the container and start the
JupyterLab server. You can access the server by navigating to http://localhost:8888 in your web browser.

To stop and remove the container, use the following command: `docker-compose down`. This will stop and remove the
container, but preserve any data in the mounted volume.
